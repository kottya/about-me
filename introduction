K.S
My passion: Dancing, watching sports, listening to music. I want to be an innovator who can contribute to the sports industry in the future.
Background: I was born and raised in Japan, and the culture shaped me into the person that I am right now. I have a younger sister, and being the oldest sibling also shaped my personality.
Interest/Inspiration: People who I respect, such as my parents, my peers and some celebrities, inspire me to become the better version of myself. I was inspired to be an innovator by being a fan of Shohei Ohtani, and knowing about a job called sports analyst.
Goals: My goal is to always improve and give myself a chance to pursue what I might be interested in. As an innovator, I aim to learn the basic skills around technology, as it is my new interest.
